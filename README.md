## Hello, I'm Heitor Oliveiro 👋 Full-Stack Web Developer in Training

I'm in the 3rd semester of **Systems Analysis and Development** (PUC Minas), where I apply agile methodologies (SCRUM) and develop a solid foundation in programming. This semester, we are working on projects focused on mobile development using React Native.

💻 I work with great enthusiasm on both my academic and professional activities, and my focus is on transforming real-world challenges into digital solutions.
